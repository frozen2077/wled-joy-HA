## Modded the official WLED integration with color temperature support (not CCT)

- Added color_temp control mode
- Changed effect list with preset list (so u can change preset on more-info page directly)
- Renamed integration name to 'wled-joy' so it can co-exist with the official one

# Installation
- Copy wled_joy folder to your custom_components folder
- Restart HA
- Add wled_joy from integration
